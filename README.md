## Project description:
This repository contains the responses to the instruction provided by BioninformHer. we were tasked to explore the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across different species using basic bioinformatics tools.
## Tools and platforms:
I used 
1. NCBI BLAST: for basic sequence alignment 
2. Clustal Omega / MUSCLE: for multiple sequence alignment between five species 
3. Skylign: for sequence logo construction
4. MEGA X: for phylogenetic tree construction
## Project tasks:
1. Sequence Retrieval & BLAST Search
2. Pairwise Sequence Alignment
3. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
4. Sequence Logo Generation
5. Phylogenetic Tree Construction
All task descriptions are detailed in the project PDF.
